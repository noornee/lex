# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information about the project

## What is Lex?
LEX (LazerEX) is a lightweight, open source frontend for reddit written in Go.

## Why create Lex?

Reddit can be very slow, and is very bloated, that's no secret. It was really annoying to either wait a super long time for a single post to load, or the UI freezing up for no apparent reason, these were just some of the issues that were common for me in every browser I tried (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc.), even more annoying, is that it uses a ton of data, meaning on slower internet connections, getting posts to load can take extremely long. Lex can save up to 60% more bandwidth, while keeping very similar image/video quality, and the time to interactive is about 800ms-1.2s on average (with all images, scripts, stylesheets loaded, note: videos are not preloaded.)

As for the UI, I went for the newer reddit redesign, but with a little tweaking.

## How do I use Lex?

Unfortunately, unlike other open source reddit frontends, **Lex does not provide a demo website**, and there is two ways to build/use Lex.

1. [Downloading a Binary and running it](#downloading-binaries)
2. [Building Lex yourself](#building-instructions)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

## Building Instructions

The only requirement to build the project is [Go](https://go.dev/dl)

If Go is installed, run the following commands in your terminal
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cmd777/lex.git
cd lex
cd src
go get -u
go build
```
and, you're pretty much done, all that's left to do is launch the built binary, and navigate to `localhost:9090/r/{subreddit}`

## Downloading Binaries

To install LEX via automatically built binaries, go to the [releases](https://github.com/cmd777/lex/releases/latest) tab, and download the appropriate zip for your OS + ARCH, and extract it.

- For 32 bit Windows machines, download `lex-windows.zip`, then launch lex-i386-windows.exe
- For 64 bit Windows machines, download `lex-windows.zip`, then launch lex-amd64-windows.exe

<br>

- For 32 bit Linux machines, download `lex-linux.zip`, then launch lex-i386-linux
- For 64 bit Linux machines, download `lex-linux.zip`, then launch lex-amd64-linux

<br>

- For Intel MacOS machines, download `lex-osx.zip`, then launch lex-amd64-osx
- For M1 MacOS machines, download `lex-osx.zip`, then launch lex-arm64-osx

After launching, navigate to `localhost:9090/r/{subreddit}`, and you're done.

# üö© Bugs, Issues, and other Important Information

Lex is still in very early stages of development, a lot of features are missing, and it might be prone to bugs, such as text overflowing, gallery buttons acting weird, and more.

I try to fix most of the critical bugs before pushing any changes, but if you find a bug, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/cmd777/lex/issues) for it.

For the features that are planned to be added, or the things that need to be fixed, you can refer to the [TODO List](https://github.com/cmd777/lex/blob/main/TODO.md)

<sub>**This list is not complete. Things are added when I find any problems, need to fix something, or from an idea I have.**</sub>

<sub>**The list is not in order of priority.**</sub>

I also work on Lex in my free time as a hobby, so development may be slow, thank you for your patience!
